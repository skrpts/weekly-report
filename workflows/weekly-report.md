## Overview

This workflow produces a weekly report from your Gmail and Google Calendar activity. It fetches a week's worth of emails and meetings, analyses themes and accomplishments, and generates a stakeholder-ready report in your voice and format.

Run it every Friday to summarise what you accomplished, what's in progress, and what's blocked — without spending 30 minutes writing it yourself.

## Pipeline Stages

### Stage 1: Week Data Fetch

**Input:** Week start date, focus areas

Using both Gmail and Calendar MCP services, fetch the week's email threads and calendar events. Tags activity related to your specified focus areas.

### Stage 2: Activity Analysis

Analyses the combined data: extracts themes, accomplishments, blockers, key meeting outcomes, and time allocation estimates.

### Stage 3: Report Synthesis

Formats the analysis into a report tailored to your audience (Team, Manager, Executive) in your chosen format (Bullet Points, Narrative, Formal).

### Stage 4: Language Polish

Final cleanup and Voice Profile alignment.

**Output:** Weekly report, ready to share.
